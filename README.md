## Southeast Asia Readiness

Welcome to the Southeast Asia Readiness project! This project aims to create a news community forum focused on the readiness of Southeast Asian countries. We will be implementing different pages using CRUD aspects to provide a seamless user experience.

## Pages

1. Home Page: This page will serve as the landing page for our forum. It will provide an overview of the latest news and updates related to Southeast Asia readiness.

2. News Page: Here, users will be able to browse and read news articles related to the readiness of Southeast Asian countries. They can also filter the articles based on specific countries or topics of interest.

3. Community Page: This page will allow users to engage in discussions and share their thoughts on Southeast Asia readiness. Users can create new posts, comment on existing posts, and interact with other community members.

4. Profile Page: Each user will have their own profile page where they can customize their preferences, view their activity history, and manage their posts and comments.

## CRUD Aspects

To ensure a comprehensive user experience, we will be implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality across the different pages of our forum. This will allow users to:

- Create new posts and comments
- Read news articles and community discussions
- Update their profile information and preferences
- Delete their own posts and comments if needed

We are excited to embark on this project and create a vibrant community forum for discussing Southeast Asia readiness. Stay tuned for more updates!
